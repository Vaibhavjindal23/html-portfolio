<h1>The Best Movies According to Vaibhav</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bhool Bhulaiya</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love the funny punches used in the movie. The main actor in the movie is 'Akshay Kumar' who plays the role of a popular pyschiatrist. </p>
<h3>Lukka Chuppi</h3>
<p>Really cool and funny movie. The starcast includes 'Kartik Aryan', 'Kriti Sanon' and 'Pankaj Tripathi'. This movie throws light on the very controversial subject- 'Live-In Relationships in India'.</p>
<h3>Golmaal</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. The humour is next level in this film.</p>
